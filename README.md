# viestinta-config
Configuration files for Viestinta

# WORK IN PROGRESS !

Requirements for running install script: 
```
- *linux* (with systemd and root access)
- docker
- docker-compose
```

Future implementations:
```
- Config for NGINX
- NGINX in Docker?
- Letsencrypt/certs should be configured manually?
- Anything to configure pulling/updating from prod and dev branches,
should be handled by Drone, but maybe there should be a script for 'deploying'?
```
